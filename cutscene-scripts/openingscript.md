## epic opening script
It starts with the camera zoomed in on a TV, there is a news report on\
news reporter (nr): today is day where the human population leaves for mars\
nr: After we polluted our own world, there is no other choice but to leave\
nr: If you haven't already, get your butt on over to your local town's ship, otherwise, you're screwed\
the camera zooms out to see tom sleeping, tom bolds up awake\
tom: oh @!%#!\
tom bolts out the door and the game begins\
we can add more to this script, this is just the basic script I'm throwing out here\
