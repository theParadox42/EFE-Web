Man on the moon (MoM) appears
MoM: Fee fi fo fum! It is I, the man on the moon!
Tom: Wait, you're the guy from dream works!
MoM: Yes that was me. However, my looks haven't quite stayed the same since i got space Diabetes
Tom: Wow, you've aged so much since then.
MoM: How dare you! I'll have you know that I'm at the young age of 4.53 billion years. I'm in my prime! I'm practically fresh out of the womb
Tom: But your hair is gray!
MoM: Shut up, space diabetes has some unspeakable effects
Tom: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned your incredibly miserable space Diabetes
MoM: You're right, you should have! Listen, why did you come to my neck of the woods?
Tom: There are no trees here
MoM: Yeah, but there are necks
Tom: You said 'neck' singular
MoM: It's a figure of speech
Tom: Ok sure. In response to your earlier inquiry, I'm here to refuel. The human race abandoned me yesterday and I am heading to Mars. Any advice?
MoM: Yeah, don't let the Martians bite you, if you do the tip of the side of your left ring finger will hurt for two weeks, four days, three hours, fourteen minutes, and seventy two seconds
Tom: There are martians?
MoM: yeah, and I'm warning you, their bites are more painful than you would believe! Don't let them bite you. Here, I want you to have this.

Tom: Ok thanks!
