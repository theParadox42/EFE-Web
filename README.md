# ESCAPE FROM EARTH
An epic game where you escape from earth
## Part I
You slept in, and today everyone is getting on the rocket ship to go to mars. You run, dodging cars & stuff (maybe crap people left behind in a rush?) to get on time. You arrive at your local escape pod, and they already left!  
(Maybe he tries for like 2 more, with some extra plat-former levels, idk)
## Part II
After missing the rocket ships, you decide to build your own before the earth blows up. Run around and collect parts in different levels to build it. You finish and take off  
(Epic space fight #1?)
## Part III
You arrive at mars, but no one is there, just some note saying they went to Venus because it was more habitable. You fight off martians to get extra fuel.
## Part IV
You fly to Venus, but go through asteroids and alien spaceships, can you survive?  
(Similar to epic space fight #1 if we include it)
## Part V
The end  
(Maybe you have to survive something on Venus too, extreme weather?)
